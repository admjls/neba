    <p>The most central feature of NEBA is the registration of Spring beans using the NEBA API, e.g. beans annotated with @ResourceModel, @Selftest and so forth. Here, NEBA attaches to the construction process
    of Spring application contexts. As soon as all beans are successfully created, but prior to the publication of the context, NEBA post-processes the context
    and looks up beans using NEBA API annotations or implementing NEBA API interfaces.</p>
