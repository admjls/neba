    <header><h2 class="title">Highlights of this release</h2></header>
    <p>
        Since 3.2.0, we've added new features to the annotations <a href="/archive/3.x/userguide.html#api/@Children">@Children</a> (resolveBelowEveryChild),
        <a href="/archive/3.x/userguide.html#api/@Reference">@Reference</a> (append) and <a href="/archive/3.x/userguide.html#api/@ResourceParam">@ResourceParam</a> (defaultValue)
        to allow even more efficient declarative use of the resource hierarchy. Furthermore, this release updates the Spring version
        shipped with the delivery package to 3.2.11, thus you benefit from <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/changelog.txt">
        all fixes and improvements added since 3.2.9</a> (shipped with NEBA 3.2.0).
    </p>
    <p>
        Along with this release, the documentation - most importantly the <a href="/archive/3.x/userguide.html">NEBA user guide</a> - was updated and improved.
    </p>
