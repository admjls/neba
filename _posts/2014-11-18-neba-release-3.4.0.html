        <h3>Introducing: Lazy loading</h3>
        <p>
            A key focus of NEBA has been - and always will be - performance. NEBA drives dynamic, high volume sites with
            vast amounts of content and strives to
            eliminate any overhead.
        </p>

        <p>We are proud to make another addition to better performing websites through the introduction of <a
                href="/old/userguide.html#lazyLoading">lazy loading for resource models</a>.</p>

        <p>
            Starting with release 3.4.0, reference collections - such as <a href="/old/userguide.html#api/@Children">@Children</a>
            of a resource or
            lists of <a href="/old/userguide.html#api/@Children">@References</a> - are automatically and transparently
            lazy-loading.
            Furthermore, any mapped field can now be explicitly lazy-loading using the new <a
                href="/old/userguide.html#api/Optional">Optional&lt;T&gt; interface</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Immediate performance gains</h3>
        <p>
            As one of the test beds for lazy loading, we used a complex AEM&trade; project featuring 100.000+ pages and
            high-volume traffic.
            An immediate performance gain resulted from upgrading to NEBA 3.4.0 - without a single line of code changed in
            the project itself:
        </p>
        <table>
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th>NEBA 3.3.0</th>
                <th>NEBA 3.4.0</th>
                <th>Performance gain</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th colspan="4" class="rowhead">Publishing environment</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Average page load time (ms)</th>
                <td>285</td>
                <td>217</td>
                <td>23%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th colspan="4" class="rowhead">Authoring environment</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Average page load time (ms)</th>
                <td>286</td>
                <td>236</td>
                <td>17%</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Release 3.4.0 has no API changes - simply update to this NEBA version to benefit from the changes.</p>
