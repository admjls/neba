    <section>
        <header><h3>A new model statistics console for real-time visualization of resource model performance</h3></header>
        <p>
            In this release, the model metadata console was replaced with the <a href="/old/userguide.html#tooling/modelstatistics">model statistics console</a>.
            This console visualizes resource model metadata collected in real-time and allows querying the collected data to find models with specific performance characteristics right in
            the browser. <a href="/old/userguide.html#tooling/modelstatistics/demo">Try the interactive demo of the model statistics console</a>.

        <header><h3>First-class support for custom annotations</h3></header>
        <p>
            One of NEBA's key goals is to enable clean separation of the project-specific implementation and
            the system-level concerns of Sling, AEM&trade; or NEBA. Consequently, NEBA offers <a href="/old/userguide.html#extending">extension points in its API</a>
            to allow adding additional functionality without depending on NEBA's implementation details.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most common use cases for these extension points is supporting custom annotations. For instance, one project featured a @Translated annotation
            allowing the injection of internationalized values into resource models. Until now, such extensions could be implemented using
            <a href="/old/userguide.html#post-processing-resourcemodels">custom post processors</a>. Now, NEBA features
            <a href="/old/userguide.html#custom-annotation-based-field-mappers">first-class support for custom annotations</a>.
            Not only does this enable easy addition of semantic annotations - it also allows extending NEBA's
            <a href="/old/userguide.html#resourceAnnotations">out-of-the-box annotations</a>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <header><h3>Support for meta-annotations</h3></header>
        <p>
            NEBA now supports meta-annotations (annotated annotations). This allows combining custom and NEBA annotations into new semantic annotations - for example
        </p>
        {% highlight java %}
        @Reference
        @Path("paths")
        @MyCustomAnnotation
        private List<Resource> pages;
        {% endhighlight %}
        <p>
            Can now be simplified by annotating @MyCustomAnnotation with NEBA's annotations instead, like so:
        </p>
        {% highlight java %}
        @Reference
        @Path("paths")
        public @interface MyCustomAnnotation { ... }
        {% endhighlight %}
        <p>
            META-annotations are supported for all of NEBA's annotations, including <a href="/old/userguide.html#api/@ResourceParam">MVC annotations</a>.
        </p>

        <header><h3>Upgrade to Spring 3.2.13</h3></header>
        <p>This release updates from Spring 3.2.11 to Spring 3.2.13. No API changes are introduced by this change, however it is recommended to upgrade project dependencies to
            this Spring version as well. Please refer to <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/changelog.txt">the Spring 3.2.x release notes</a> regarding the corresponding changes.</p>

        <header><h3>Upgrading from 3.4.0</h3></header>
        <p>
            Simply upgrade your dependencies and re-deploy NEBA - there are no incompatible API changes in this release. Note that the version of Spring
            contained in the <a href="/download.html#installation">delivery package</a> was updated from 3.2.11 to 3.2.13, which should be reflected in
            the projects dependencies as well.
