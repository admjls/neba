        <header><h3>AEM 5.6 to AEM 6.1 support: Getting the filter order right</h3></header>
        <p>
            From AEM 5.6 to AEM 6.1, the <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-2920">meaning of the
            filter.order property</a> of sling filters changed. To support both
            versions, NEBA 3.6.0 automatically detects the AEM version it is running on and adjusts the order of its
            filters accordingly. Using NEBA 3.6.x is thus strongly recommended
            for AEM versions > 5.6 or Sling versions with Sling engine > 2.3.2.

        <header><h3>Handling rotated logfiles in the log file viewer</h3></header>
        <p>
            Since 3.6.0, the <a href="/old/userguide.html#tooling_logviewer">log viewer console</a> automatically hides
            rotated logfile versions, giving administrators a focus on the most recent log files.
        </p>

        <h3>Improved filtering in the NEBA model statistics console</h3>
        <p>
            The model statistics console now got even better at automatically completing filter expressions. Any
            expression can now quickly be created by
            typing and applying the autocompletion suggestions.
        </p>

        <h3>HTTP OPTIONS and TRACE requests now passed to @Controllers</h3>
        <p>
            In Spring, OPTIONS and TRACE requests are usually <a
                href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23103832/spring-mvc-does-not-handle-requestmethod-options">answered
            with a default response by the DispatcherServlet</a>. NEBA
            now overrides this default and routes these methods to registered controllers, thus enabling proper
            implementation of CORS for RESTful Spring controllers.

        <p>
            Simply upgrade your dependencies and re-deploy NEBA - there are no incompatible API changes in this release.
            Note that the version of Spring
            contained in the <a href="/download.html#installation">delivery package</a> was updated from 3.2.13 RELEASE
            1 to 3.2.13 RELEASE 2, which should be reflected in
            project dependencies as well.
