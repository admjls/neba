                <div class="one">
                    <p>
                        Since AEM 6.0, the javax.inject package is provided out of the box. To avoid conflicts between two different versions of javax.inject, the NEBA 3.7.0 delivery
                        package no longer contains the <a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/servicemix/bundles/org.apache.servicemix.bundles.javax-inject/1_1/">javax.inject OSGi bundle</a>.
                        Furthermore, the Spring artifacts shipped with NEBA support the javax.inject version shipped with AEM (0.0.0). See <a href="#upgrading">upgrade instructions</a> for the recommended
                        way to use javax.inject with 3.7.0.

                    <p>
                        Since 3.7.0, the <a href="/userguide.html#tooling_modelstatistics">model statistics</a> have an improved handling of nested mappings of the same resource model type. In such cases - for instance
                        deep mapping hierarchies of pages - answering the question how many subsequent mappings or mapping durations the corresponding model exhibits becomes more difficult as the model effectively contains itself.
                        Since 3.7.0, only the effective number of subsequent mappings are counted per model type. The same applies to the mapping duration. This gives a more realistic view of the effective mapping
                        durations and subsequent mappings per resource model type.

                <h3>New delivery bundle for standalone Sling installations</h3>
                <p>
                    Since 3.7.0, NEBA and all of its thirdparty dependencies can be installed to non-AEM Sling installations using just one delivery bundle. The OSGi bundle leverages Sling's <a href="https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/content-loading-jcr-contentloader.html">content loading</a>
                    to provide NEBA and its dependencies to Sling's JCR installer.

                <h4>Changes in javax.inject support</h4>

                <p>
                    If you are using javax.inject with NEBA in an AEM or Sling version that does not provide javax.inject yet (e.g. AEM < 6.0), make sure to deploy the <a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/servicemix/bundles/org.apache.servicemix.bundles.javax-inject/1_1/">javax.inject bundle</a>
                    with your application - it is <a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/issues/69">no longer included in the delivery package</a>.
                    Otherwise, make sure to transition to the out of the box javax.inject version provided via org.apache.sling.scripting.java, e.g. in AEM 6.1:

                    {% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.sling</groupId>
    <artifactId>org.apache.sling.scripting.java</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.12</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
                    {% endhighlight %}

                </p>

                <h4>AEM delivery package with new artifact ID</h4>
                <p>
                    The artifact id of the AEM delivery packages was changed for disambiguation due to the introduction of a delivery package for Sling standalone (<a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/issues/72">#72</a>).
                    The artifact ID is now <em>io.neba.neba-delivery-aem</em>. Please update your dependencies accordingly.
                </p>

                <h4>Minor Spring upgrade</h4>
                <p>
                    Note that the version of Spring contained in the <a href="/download.html#installation">delivery package</a> was updated from 3.2.13
                    RELEASE 2 to 3.2.14 RELEASE 1, which should be reflected in project dependencies as well.
                </p>
