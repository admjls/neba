        <p>
            NEBA explicitly supports lazy-loading fields via the <a href="/userguide.html#api_Optional">Optional</a>
            interface. With 3.8.0, <a href="/userguide.html#custom-annotation-based-field-mappers">fields with custom
            annotations</a> can now
            use the same interface. The custom annotation processors will then be applied in a lazy fashion.
