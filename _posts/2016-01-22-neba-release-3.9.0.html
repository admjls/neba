        <p>
            This release is the last <em>planned</em> 3.x release prior to NEBA 4, and thus the last planned release
            supporting legacy (&lt;AEM 6.0) versions of Apache Sling and AEM. While issues
            of the 3.x branch will continue to be fixed, active development of new features will now be focusing on NEBA
            4 (<a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/milestones/4.0.0">see NEBA 4 road map</a>).

        <header><h3>Improved fault tolerance</h3></header>
        <p>
            NEBA now prevents potential exceptions in Sling BackgroundHttpServletRequest(s) occurring when access to
            the session is attempted (<a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/issues/95">#95</a>) and
            tolerates null arguments to reference listeners (<a
                href="https://github.com/unic/neba/issues/102">#102</a>). Furthermore, the error message reported
            when an application
            attempts to synchronously access the resource resolver factory during a restart has been improved (<a
                href="https://github.com/unic/neba/issues/96">#96</a>).
