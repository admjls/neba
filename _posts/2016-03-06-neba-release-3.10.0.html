        <header><h3>Improved support of the Sling 8 standalone application</h3></header>
        <p>
            The <a href="http://sling.apache.org/downloads.cgi#application">Sling standalone application</a> no longer
            ships with the bgservlets bundle by default. NEBA 3.10.0 thus made
            the dependency to the corresponding package optional. Consequently, Sling 8 users must no longer deploy the
            bgservlets bundle for NEBA to work (<a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/issues/108">#108</a>).
            Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/mnimer">Mike Nimer</a> for reporting this!

        <header><h3>Improved method contract for <a href="/archive/3.x/userguide.html#api_PreMapping-and-PostMapping">@PostMapping
            and @PreMapping</a></h3></header>
        <p>
            With 3.10.0, methods annotated with <a href="/archive/3.x/userguide.html#api_PreMapping-and-PostMapping">@PostMapping
            or @PreMapping</a> must no longer be public
            (<a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/issues/106">#106</a>), thus users are no longer forced to potentially
            publish implementation details as API.
            Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/djessup">djessup</a> for the contribution!

            <a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/issues/106">#106 @PostConstruct only works on public methods, forcing
                developers to expose implementation contracts </a><br/>
