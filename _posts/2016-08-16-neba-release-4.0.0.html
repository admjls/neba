    <section>
        <header><h3>NEBA 4.0.0 ships with Spring 4</h3></header>
        <p>
           NEBA 4.0.0 ships with Spring 4, bringing with it <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/new-in-4.0.html">improved Java 8 support and many more valuable features, such as support for WebSockets</a>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <header><h3>Exclusive Support for Java 8</h3></header>
        <p>
            Support for Java version less then 8 has been discontinued,
            as they have officially reached <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html">end of life</a> and are
            <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-2/deploy/technical-requirements.html#Java%20Virtual%20Machines">no longer support by AEM 6.2</a>.
            However, the NEBA 3.x branch - which is still actively maintained - continues to support these legacy versions.
        </p>

    <section>
        <header><h3>Extended Spring MVC support</h3></header>
        <p>
            With NEBA 4.0.0, one can now leverage all features of Spring MVC - including those requiring a WebApplicationContext, for instance
            <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{{springDocumentationVersion}}/spring-framework-reference/html/view.html#view-jsp-formtaglib">the Spring Forms Tag Library</a>.
        </p>
        <p>In addition, NEBA 4.0.0 also enables <a href="/documentation.html#mvc_sling_views">using Sling scripts as Spring Controller Views, thus fusing the power of Spring MVC views with Sling's mighty Script resolution</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <header><h3>Out of the box support for automated Spring MVC JSON responses</h3></header>
        <p>
            NEBA 4.0.0 now ships with the jackson libraries required to automatically provide controller responses as JSON,
            e.g. via content negotiation. All that is required is <a href="/documentation.html#spring_mvc">setting up the MVC infrastructure</a>
            in the blueprint XML, like so:
{% highlight xml %}
<mvc:annotation-driven />
{% endhighlight %}
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <header><h3>Automated Model Lookup for Adobe HTL (formerly known as Sightly)</h3></header>
        <p>
            You no longer need to couple your HTL (Sightly) view to an explicit model class - just use
{% highlight xml %}
data-sly-use.<modelName>="/apps/neba/neba.js"
{% endhighlight %}
            and NEBA will <a href="/documentation.html#using_models_in_views">provide the most specific model automatically</a>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <header><h3>A brand-new, Web Sockets based Log Viewer</h3></header>
        <p>
            The <a href="/documentation.html#tooling_logviewer">NEBA log viewer</a> now uses WebSockets to receive logfile updates
            in real time. In addition, advanced stacktrace detection was added to the viewer - and requests in the request.log are automatically linked
            to their response.

    <section>
        <header><h3>Support for AEM 6.1+ and Sling 8+</h3></header>
        <p>
            With AEM 6.1 and Sling 8, significant improvements have been introduced to the underlying frameworks, including breaking API changes.
            To better support these modern platforms, NEBA 4.x currently supports AEM versions 6.1+ and Sling 8+.
            Previous Platforms are supported by the 3.x branch of NEBA, which will be actively maintained until the
            <a href="https://www.adobe.com/support/products/enterprise/eol/eol_matrix.html">EOL of AEM 6.0</a> core support in June 2017.
        </p>

    <section>
        <header><h3>Adobe HTL (formerly Sightly) and Sling Healthchecks replace Velocity rendering and @SelfTest </h3></header>
        <p>
            Since early versions of AEM 5.x and Sling 7, features previously exclusive to NEBA have made it into the product core. To further the use
            of product best-practices, NEBA no longer ships with support for velocity as a template mechanism and with @SelfTest support.
            Users of these features can either continue to use NEBA 3.x, which is actively maintained until June 2017, or transition to
            <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/htl/overview.html">Adobe HTL</a> and
            <a href="https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/sling-health-check-tool.html">Sling Health Checks</a>.

        <header><h3 id="upgrading">Upgrading from 3.10.0</h3></header>
        <p>
            NEBA 4.0.0 contains no breaking changes in the main Resource Model API, i.e. the annotations.
        </p>
        <p>NEBA 4.0.0 Supports AEM 6.1+. Users of previous AEM versions can continue to use NEBA 3.x, which is actively maintained until June 2017. </p>
        <p>NEBA 4.0.0 requires using JAVA 8+. Users of legacy Java versions can continue to use NEBA 3.x, which is actively maintained until June 2017.</p>
        <p>
            Users of @SelfTest are encouraged to transition to the platform standard,
            <a href="https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/sling-health-check-tool.html">Sling Health Checks</a>, as @SelfTest is discontinued in favor of these platform standards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users of Velocity templating, for instance the &lt;neba:render ...&gt; JSP tag library, are encouraged to transition to
            either <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/htl/overview.html">Adobe HTL</a> or
            <a href="https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/scripting/scripting-thymeleaf.html">Thymeleaf</a>, as Velocity support
            is discontinued in favor of these platform standards.
        </p>
        <p>Neba 4.0.0 ships with Spring 4.2.6. Project dependencies must be updated to the
            <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.apache.servicemix.bundles%22%20AND%20a%3Aorg.apache.servicemix.bundles.spring-*%20AND%20v%3A%224.2.6.RELEASE_1%22">respective Spring bundle versions</a>.</p>
