        <header><h3>Transitioned to Java 8+, Fade out support for CQ 5.3 - CQ 5.5</h3></header>
        <p>
            For reasons of legacy support, NEBA was still based on JDK 6. This changed along with <a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/issues/50">#50</a>,
            i.e. once the majority of deployments have migrated to the current AEM versions and have upgraded to more recent JVM versions.

            Transitioning to this version makes sense if the benefits outweigh the resulting backwards compatibility issues.
            Also, just switching to the new version yields no benefit in itself. A Benefit would only result when refactoring
            the NEBA core code to leverage the new functional programming elements - which effectively ends backwards compatibility.

        <header><h3>Remove velocity support</h3></header>
        <p>
            NEBA uses Apache Velocity to support rendering beyond resources (http://neba.io/userguide.html#using-velocity).
            However, there has been no update for velocity since 2010 (https://velocity.apache.org/). Furthermore, almost all
            uses of bean rendering seen in practice were not as intended. For instance, velocity views are used to render
            resource models or data otherwise stemming from resources.

            With the availability of Sightly as a powerful templating language, velocity support was removed from NEBA. Users of velocity
            are thus encouraged to use Sightly, the JSP expression language or custom tag libraries instead.
