        <p>
           NEBA 4.1.0 updates Spring 4.2 to 4.2.8, the current GA (generally available) version (<a href="https://jira.spring.io/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=15596&styleName=Text&projectId=10000">release notes</a>).

        <header><h3>Improved support for multiple version of the AEM Social Component Framework (SCF)</h3></header>
        <p>
            AEM ships with out of the box versions of the <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-2/develop/communities/scf.html">Social Component Framework</a>
            that bring in a lot of third-party dependencies and package exports. Out of the box versions of
            SCF, for instance, include a partial export of the fasterxml Jackson libraries residing on the private classpath of one of the SCF bundles.
            This is incompatible with Spring, which (rightfully) relies on libraries being fully, not just partially, available.
            However, recent upgrades to the SCF fixed this issue by providing the jackson libraries as OSGi bundles.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means NEBA needs to be able to run without these libraries, with a partial presence of these libraries and with the libraries being deployed as OSGi bundles.
            In 4.1.0, the corresponding imports in the Spring bundles shipped with NEBA were adjusted to meet these requirements, making NEBA function seamlessly regardless of
            the SCF deployment status.
