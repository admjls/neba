        <p>
            Release 4.3.0 extends NEBA's compatibility: NEBA now runs smoothly on Sling 7, 8 and the latest <a href="https://sling.apache.org/news/sling-launchpad-9-released.html">Sling version 9</a>.

        <p>
            With 4.3.0, NEBA introduces the <a href="/apidocs/neba-api/io/neba/api/resourcemodels/Lazy.html">Lazy</a> interface for declaring lazy-loading 1:1 relationships. Using
            this interface, one can benefit from the well-supported <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html">java.util.Optional</a> representation
            of potentially empty values. In addition, the Lazy interface API itself has all semantics of the <em>java.util.Optional</em> type. This makes possible a rather elegant use of lazy-loading (and thus potentially missing) values:
        </p>
{% highlight java %}
@ResourceModel(types = "some/resource/Type")
public class MyModel {
    @Reference
    private Lazy<Asset> asset;

    public Rendition getSmallRendition() {
        return linkedAsset.map(asset -> asset.getRendition("small")).orElse(null);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
        <br />
        <p>
            This interface replaces the previous <a href="/apidocs/neba-api/io/neba/api/resourcemodels/Optional.html">"Optional"</a> interface. Users of NEBA 4.x &lt; 4.3.0 are encouraged to
            transition to the Lazy interface. The <em>io.neba.api.Optional</em> interface has been deprecated and will be removed in NEBA 5.x.

        <p>
            Users of 4.2.1 can upgrade to 4.3.0 without code changes. Note, however, that the version of the packages exported by the NEBA API has been updated to 4.3.0, to reflect the addition of
            the new Lazy Interface to the API. Furthermore, the <a href="/apidocs/neba-api/io/neba/api/resourcemodels/Optional.html">Optional</a> interface has been deprecated in the process. User of NEBA's <em>Optional</em> are encouraged
            to transition to <a href="/apidocs/neba-api/io/neba/api/resourcemodels/Lazy.html">Lazy</a> instead.
