            NEBA enables the development of clean, high-performing and easy to change solutions on Apache Sling-based applications such as Adobe AEMâ„¢. NEBA integrates the Spring Framework into Apache Sling, exclusively using the standardized reference implementation of the OSGi Compendium R4.2 specification.
            NEBA is 100% open source and published under the Apache license 2.0. <a href="https://www.github.com/unic/neba">Fork it on Github!</a>

                    <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{{site.springDocumentationVersion}}/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-introduction">Spring Beans</a> representing
                    specific resource types. Whenever a suitable resource is adapted to this model - or any of it's interfaces or super classes - the properties
                    of the resource are automatically injected into the model. One can thus use the entire power of Spring and all features of Sling and the JCR - with just
                    one annotation.

                    To let engineering analyze issues quickly, NEBA includes a Sling web console extension
                    that allows monitoring, tailing and downloading log files - including filtering and highlighting.
                    Serial access to the machine running your instance is no longer required - authenticated
                    access to the system does suffice.
